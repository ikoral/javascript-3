this module is a bit different (again) from the last.

## Week Projects

The week projects are all aligned with video tutorials.  You'll have to follow along and complete the project taught in the tutorial like you did once in HTML/CSS.  BUT  working code does not a finished project make!  You'll need to follow the tutorials twice, and your final homework submission isn't just the working code but a complete repository with branches and everything (something [like this](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/built-with-branches/)).

You'll need to have these branches:
* master: this branch will only contain working code, each commit will be the final code of each step branch
* (descriptive name here): each other branch will be used to develop one step of the tutorial and will be merged into master before moving on to the next step


## Practice Problems

The practice problems in this module are not required, but are highly recommended.  You can study them however you like, but each week's project will have a list of recommended practice problems.
